# Experiment No.5: 

The aim is to demonstrate the use of try-catch statements to handle runtime exceptions and ensure the program 
continues executing even after encountering an error.

A. Write a program to demonstrate a try catch statement. 


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10, b = 0;
        try {
            int result = a / b;
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }
        System.out.println("Program continues after try-catch block.");
}
}
